# FriendFinder

### Welcome to the Warriors Friend Finder App

This simple app is akin to many of the "survey and match" games/apps that you can find on facebook and online in general.

You will answer a survey of 10 questions, with options of strongly disagreeing(1) to strongly agreeing(5).  Based on your answers, you will be matched up with the Golden State Warrior player that answered the same questions, closest to you. 

The 10 questions are mostly basketball related, and the stored answers for each player were chosen with their play-style, personality, as well as off-court activities in mind.

The objective of this project was to create our first full-stack application.  Specifically in using a middleware framework, such as express to create routing two-way routing between our serverside and clientside code.

Node dependencies - express, body-parser, and path
